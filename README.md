Personal Site


***NOTE***: This is due to change as I'm ditching jekyll and all things ruby. How this is going to end up is unclear.

This is my personal site that functions as a portfolio and link to all my socials. It is a major WIP so take anything shown with a grain of salt. It is not a reflection of what the end product will be at this point.
